## Objective

Define the specific goal of this lab.

Example:
- Deploy a hardened private cloud server using Nextcloud and Matrix.
- Set up self-hosted SIEM detection with Wazuh.

---

## Environment

Document the lab setup:
- Hardware (e.g., VPS provider, local VM specs)
- Operating Systems
- Network Configuration
- Any restrictions or assumptions

---

## Tools and Technologies

List all major tools, languages, and frameworks used.

Example:
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- Ansible
- WireGuard
- Fail2ban
- Python (for scripting)

---

## Methodology

Brief explanation of the approach taken to complete the lab.

Example:
- Infrastructure as Code for deployments (Ansible).
- Manual hardening steps logged and verified.
- Automation of backups using Bash scripts.

---

## Steps

Document detailed steps taken.

Example:
1. Deploy VPS instance with Ubuntu 22.04.
2. Configure basic firewall rules (UFW).
3. Install and configure WireGuard.
4. Test secure mesh networking between nodes.

Use sub-bullets if necessary.
